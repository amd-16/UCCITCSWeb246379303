            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.</p>
            <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }</code>
            <code>greetMe("World");</code>

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <p>If you're completely new to programming, you might want to start with some introductory tutorials before diving into JavaScript.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.</p>
            <p>The prototype-based inheritance model is more dynamic than Java's class-based inheritance model. It allows for the addition of properties and methods to individual objects without affecting other objects of the same type.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <p>This simple function takes a name as input and returns a greeting. It demonstrates the basic syntax of JavaScript functions.</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { 
    return "Hello " + yourName; 
}</code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
            <p>You can also use the browser's console to test simple JavaScript commands interactively.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>JavaScript has three ways to declare variables: var, let, and const. Each has different scoping rules and behaviors.</p>
            <code>var x = 42;</code>
            <code>let y = 13;</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Variables declared with var are function-scoped</li>
                <li>Variables declared with let are block-scoped</li>
                <li>Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned</li>
            </ul>
